                        The hunt for NPF took over nineteen minutes, and involved more than zero people.<br>

                        (<i>Universidad Real de Madrid</i>) embarked on the hunt for a completely real and
                        definitely not made-up protein named <i>Neural Pairing Factor</i>, implicated in
                        mind-reading and ESP-related pathways in mammalian cortex.

                        The protein's behavior was as-of-yet uncharacterized formally, and Verdadero believed
                        his team would be the first to deliver conclusive evidence of its extraordinary
                        activity.

                        NPF works by quantum-tangling a particle inside a trans-membrane loop domain with a
                        water molecule that passes through the brain. When the molecule leaves the BBB, the
                        tangle properties remain, and the state of the transmembrane domain can be detected
                        externally using photometry, and other pseudoscience buzzwords. Totally real!
